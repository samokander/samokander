## Hi! 👋

My name is Andrei, and I’m a Solidity Smart Contract Developer.

My core technologies: Solidity, TypeScript, Hardhat, ethers.js, OpenZeppelin. I am passionate about cross-chain technologies and improving user experiences through account abstraction! Also currently I am diving deeper into zkSNARKS and its application in off-chain computations and proofs of inclusion. 

### Projects summaries:

- 💸 [Arbitrage Bot](https://github.com/samokander/arbitrage): Created smart contracts to automate arbitrage trades across over 200 pools, generating consistent profits on Polygon and Evmos chains. 

  💡Technologies: Solidity, Node.js, Hardhat, Uniswap V3, AAVE

- 💳 [Ethereum Wallet](https://github.com/samokander/aio-contracts): Built a non-custodial Ethereum wallet with integrated token swap functionality to enhance user accessibility, as well as ERC-20 compliant token and smart contract for vested presale.

  💡Technologies: Solidity, React.js, Hardhat, Ethers.js, ERC-20, Uniswap V2, Pancakeswap

- ⛓️ [Cross-Chain Solutions](https://github.com/samokander/xNFT): Designed and implemented cross-chain technologies during hackathon, focusing on seamless interoperability between networks.

  💡Technologies: Solidity, Node.js, Hardhat, zkEVM, ERC-721

- 📍[Account Abstraction](https://github.com/samokander/bundler): Developed a dApp utilizing account abstraction techniques to simplify user onboarding while ensuring robust security.

  💡Technologies: Solidity, Node.js, Hardhat, ERC-4337, Proxy Patterns, Uniswap V3, React.js, Ethers.js
